# SynGait
The SeeGait codebase implements a hierarchical multi-stage, bidirectional cross-modal attention framework that co-evolves skeleton and silhouette features for robust multimodal gait recognition, with complete training, evaluation, and visualization scripts to reproduce results on CASIA-B/CCPG/SUSTech1K.
